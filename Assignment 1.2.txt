Ans:- setwd("c:/R/mergeme") 0r specific file path name files=list.files(pattern=".xlsx") 
for(i in 1:length(files)) {filename=files[i] data=read.xlsx(file = filename,header = T) assign(x = filename,value = data)}
 #Suppose the columns are the same for each file, 
#you can bind them together in one dataframe with bind_rows from dplyr: library(dplyr) #one more option is as follows df<-lapply(files, read.xlsx) %>% bind_rows()
